# In Situ Prediction of Battery States via Implantable Perovskite Sensor and Machine Learning
This is the repo for the project In Situ Prediction of Battery States via Implantable Perovskite Sensor and Machine Learning

This software package includes code for analyzing sensor data under different charge-discharge cycles. It contains code for extracting time-series resistance signals from sensors using STM32, code for training a Random Forest (RF) model to predict battery charge-discharge curves and capacity, as well as code for training an RF model for classifying charge-discharge rates.
